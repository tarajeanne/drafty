Requirements:
- Pi Zero 2W
- Micro SD Card (faster is better, in theory)
- Waveshare 4.2" Rev 2.2 wired into the Pi Zero 2W (refer to https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/4.2inch_e-Paper_Module_Manual pinouts)
- Power for your Pi Zero

1. Run The Raspberry Pi Imager

https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/

- Download and run the raspberry pi imager. This tool just formats your SD card to create the computer that runs the typewriter.
- Use Debian Bookworm Lite 32bit. The pi zero2w is VERY constrained for memory. You may have reliability issues with the display driver if you use a desktop OS or 64bit OS.
- Use the gear icon to add extra settings to your install: 
- Add your WIFI credentials. Set a hostname (zerowriter.local suggested) and username/password (zero/whateveryouwant) which will be used for connecting
- Enable SSH. This is required so you can configure the typewriter remotely, without a traditional display.
- Run the tool and it will wipe the SD card and install the image.

2. Estabilish SSH connection

- Install the SD card to the Pi, and connect to power. You should see blinking lights as it completes the first boot.
- After a minute or so, open up Windows Power Shell or Terminal or whatever command line tool you want to use
- Connect to your pi zero via: 
- ssh zero@zerowriter.local
- Your computer will connect to the pi zero and do some security stuff -- if you have errors here, there's usually an easy fix if you google it.
- You will connect and be greeted with the pi zero's command line, woohoo, you are in the matrix.

3. Configure Via SSH

> Follow these commands in order to set up the pi zero with the stuff it needs to run the typewriter:

sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade

> and then (can copy paste these if easier):

sudo apt install pip
sudo apt-get install python3-pil
sudo apt-get install python3-numpy
sudo pip3 install keyboard
sudo pip3 install yagmail
sudo pip3 install qrcode

> note: "if you get externally managed error:" sudo pip3 install keyboard --break-system-packages

sudo raspi-config
> (enable SPI via sudo raspi-config -> interface so your display will run)
> (system options -> boot auto login -> console autologin) -- this is to help autostart things later

> Clone the code from github to your pi so you can run the typewriter:

sudo apt install git
git clone -b waveshare_2.2 https://github.com/zerowriter/zerowriter1.git

> Navigate to the typewriter's directory and run it:

cd zerowriter1/e-Paper/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python/examples
sudo python main.py

> Make sure the typewriter runs before you keep going. If you run into weirdness, you can reboot via the command: sudo reboot now
> If you followed these steps, and you connected the display correctly, you should be running the sooftware now!

3.1: Hey! I lost connectivity / screen is frozen but i see text / things stopped working here:

There is a known bug which may cause your pi zero to lose wifi connection after the first boot / setup. In this case, you need to connect your pi to HDMI and reconfigure wifi in sudo raspi-config and then you will be good to go again. This only needs to be done once. This bug is because of the network controller in the zerowriter software which lets you join wifi networks (like a regular computer).

3.2: Network Troubleshooting

> If you do not see Wifi networks in the menu, it means that your pi hasn't initialized the controller yet.
sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager 
> should fix it. But note this will probably kill your SSH connection and you may need to connect to a display to get to the command line again.

4. Configure bashrc (do this after you get the typewriter running correctly from command line) (seriously, don't do this until you are sure the application works)

> Bashrc gets your pi zero to run stuff on boot up. 
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
> scroll to the bottom and add the lines: 
cd zerowriter1/e-Paper/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python/examples/
sudo python main.py
> CTRL + O to save (write out) the file, CTRL + X to exit.
sudo reboot now
> it should boot to the typewriter automatically now.

Optional Steps Below
--------

5. (Optional) Overclock your pi zero

You can adjust your Pi Zero's settings to get better theoretical performance at the cost of power consumption.

> at command line, type:
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
> checkout youtube or google for pi zero 2w overclocking suggestions
> overclocking can affect system stability, if you run into problems, you may be unable to boot. If that happens, take the SD card out and insert into your computer, edit the boot/config.txt file back to lower values.
> if you overclocked too far, your system stability might drop and you will get unresponsiveness or services failure (wifi for example) and sometimes display corruption or memory issues

6. (Optional) Install SMB for file access (recomended if you are developing / building on the python code)

> If you want to easily access and manage your files from another computer, you should install SMB to your pi.

FAQ / COMMON TROUBLESHOOTING
-----

Q: The zerowriter application starts, but I don't see anything / screen is blank.
A: Check your wiring. Double check it. Triple check it. Run the waveshare demo code and make sure that works correctly. If the waveshare demo code works, the zerowriter should have no problem.

Q: The screen is upside down, distorted, tilted, italicized, or generally weird... help?
A: When the display fails initialization, it does some weird stuff. Try CTRL+R to force a refresh. If the problem persists, try rebooting the device. Make sure you are running a 32-bit lite OS. Memory issues, like memory leaks or other competing applications, can cause the display to act strangely.

Welcome!

Youtube Script:

The ctrl r refreshes the screen
to give it a nice clean slate.

Ok, back to scripting...

First section should be shots of 
the previous zerowriter footage. 
Voiceover should talk about how
i was surprised to find out
waveshare discontinued my
display...

second section should be this
footage. the demo footage of the 
new refresh rates in the 2.2

third section should be the new
features in the menu and the
future of the project.

and the fourth section should be 
about the next steps −− the top
secret stuff for youtube
followers and reddit people...

neat ;)
